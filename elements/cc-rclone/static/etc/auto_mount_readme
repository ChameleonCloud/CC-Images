The "cc_my_mounting_point" directory under /home/cc is the base
mounting point to the Chameleon object store, so that you can access
the object store as a file system. Within this directory different
directories map to containers you have mounted in the object store.

The mount is facilitated by rclone [1].

You can mount the object store by running:

cc-mount-object-store start your_container_name

You can check if the mount is running with:

cc-mount-object-store status your_container_name

And you can terminate the rclone mount with:

cc-mount-object-store stop your_container_name

Finally, you can list all running mounts with:

cc-mount-object-store list

If there is a directory that is unmounted, it should have an empty
file in the directory named THIS_IS_NOT_MOUNTED, for example:
~/cc_my_mounting_point/your_container_name/THIS_IS_NOT_MOUNTED.

If there is no container with the name you provide when you
start the mount, it will be created by rclone as soon as you copy
files into the directory.

WARNING:

The use of "cc_my_mounting_point" to sync files between your instance
and the object store is a best effort tool. It is the responsibilty
of the user to verify the files sync'd correctly and are valid.

Given the challenges of mapping files in a file system to an object
store over a network, numerous problems can occur that may impact
the availability of files on the object store. If you attempt
to copy files into the mount point and receive errors, it is
important that you verify the existence and contents of the file
in the object store and not simply assume the file has been
persisted there (even if it is present in the mount point).
