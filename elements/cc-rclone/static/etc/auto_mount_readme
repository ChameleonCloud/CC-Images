The "my_mounting_point" directory under /home/cc is the mounting
point to the Chameleon object store, so that you can access the
object store as a file system.

The mount is facilitated by rclone [1].

You can check if the rclone mount is running:

ps -aux | grep rclone

If the process is not running or needs to be started again, you
can do so with:

rclone mount rclone_s3: /home/cc/my_mounting_point --daemon

WARNING:

The use of "my_mounting_point" to sync files between your instance
and the object store is a best effort tool. It is the responsibilty
of the user to verify the files sync'd correctly and are valid.

Given the challenges of mapping files in a file system to an object
store over a network, numerous problems can occur that may impact
the availability of files on the object store. If you attempt
to copy files into the mount point and receive errors, it is
important that you verify the existence and contents of the file
in the object store and not simply assume the file has been
persisted there (even if it is present in the mount point).
