The "my_mounting_point" directory under /home/cc is the mounting
point to the Chameleon object store, so that you can access the
object store as a file system.

A mounting tool known as cc-cloudfuse has been installed. You can
use cc-cloudfuse to mount/unmout the Chameleon object store.

To mount:
cc-cloudfuse mount <mounting_dir> [options]

To see details about mount options:
cc-cloudfuse mount -h

To unmount:
cc-cloudfuse unmount <mounting_dir>
