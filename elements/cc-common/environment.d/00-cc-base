# DIB_BOOTLOADER_DEFAULT_CMDLINE sets parameters that are appended to the
# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT values in grub.cfg configuration.
# defaults to nofb nomodeset gfxpayload=text.
# - nofb: removed, appears to be a no-op for ~20 years??
# - nomodeset: removed, causes all sorts of issues with amdgpu,
#              and can cause excessive on some baremetal servers!
# - gfxpayload=text: kept; probably ok, tells grub not to leave it at `auto`,
#                    and only impacts what video drivers load
# - pci=realloc=off: added needed to handle badness on ubuntu with ubuntu and multi-gpus
#                    centos distros have it turned off already
