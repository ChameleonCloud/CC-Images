# This file describes the images which are available to build, and the images upon which they are
# cache-dependent. This is purely for use by our scripts; diskimage-builder doesn't know about it

# The format of an image is as follows:
# CC-Image:  (this is the name of the image which will show up on production sites)
#   arch: (These are the supported CPU architectures of the image)
#     - amd64
#     - arm64
#   baremetal_only: (Boolean, describes if this image is only intended for baremetal sites, or can be used on KVM as well)
#   provenance: (Describes some attributes used to tag the image. Any values not defined will be inherited from parents)
#     distro: ubuntu
#     release: jammy
#     variant: {base,gpu,fpga}
#   artifacts: (Maps environment variable names to object store artifacts so tmp links can be passed to the build)
#     DIB_ARTIFACT_EXAMPLE:
#       object: container/object
#       site: {tacc,uc}
